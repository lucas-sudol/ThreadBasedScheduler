# Project Title

A1 - Pthreads Based Scehduler

## Description
Uses linux Pthreads to to perform thread based scheudling of PI computations.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
POSIX compatible operating system

### Executing program

* How to build and run the program
make all

./pthreads fileName flag (true/false print output)
./serial n(calculation of pi) - for single threaded calculations of pi

filename - name of a text file to provide instuctural inputs

File Template
    thread count - eg 4
    number of interactions to calculate pi to - 100000 
    number of interactions to calculate pi to - 100000 
    number of interactions to calculate pi to - 100000 
    number of interactions to calculate pi to - 100000  
                                                        - each new line is a scheduled task to be added to the queue
                                                          tasks are not broken up further

* include the expected output

pthreads
serial
